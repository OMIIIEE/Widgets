# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Steps to run the program 
1.  clone the repository to your local system  or download the zip file 
2. Go to project Directory "WIDGETWAVE"
3. run the command "npm install" to install all the required packages
4. run the command "npm run dev" to start the development server
5. open the browser and go to "http://localhost:5173/" to see the application
6. run the command "npm run build" to build the application
